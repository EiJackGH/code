## 2024-05-23 - CLI UX Enhancement
**Learning:** Even in CLI apps, visual distinction (colors, emojis) significantly reduces cognitive load when scanning logs.
**Action:** Use ANSI colors and consistent emojis for key events (success/failure) in future CLI tools.

## 2025-02-28 - Structured CLI Reports
**Learning:** Dense numerical data in CLI output is hard to parse. Using ASCII box-drawing characters and alignment to create a "dashboard" or "invoice" style summary significantly improves readability and perceived quality.
**Action:** When summarizing simulation or batch job results, always format the final report as a structured table or box rather than a list of print statements.
## 2024-05-20 - Dynamic Progress Bar for Quiet CLI Tasks
**Learning:** For long-running CLI processes that suppress verbose logging (e.g., `--quiet`), users lose system status visibility.
**Action:** Implemented a dynamic progress bar using `\r` and `flush=True`, conditional on `sys.stdout.isatty()`, to provide status feedback without polluting non-interactive logs.

## 2025-03-23 - Game Key Scrolling
**Learning:** Browsers natively scroll the page when users press Space or Arrow keys. When building a web-based game, this creates a frustrating UX where the game viewport jumps around while playing.
**Action:** Always call `e.preventDefault()` on keydown events for typical game controls ("Space", "ArrowUp", etc.) when the focus is on a game container or the body.

## 2023-10-25 - Cross-Platform CLI Exit Prompt
**Learning:** Using OS-specific commands like system("pause") for basic UX features breaks usability on other platforms and lacks clear accessibility instruction.
**Action:** Replace system("pause") with standard input stream functions (cin.get()) paired with explicit instructional text (e.g., "Press Enter to exit...") to ensure consistent, accessible behavior across all platforms.
